# Miruken ci.cd

Tools and helpers for setting up ci/cd pipelines. We value:

* code that is checked into source control
* code that can be executed on a developers machine
* deploying the exact same bits that were build and tested

Concepts and abstractions:

* Docker Containers
* Control flow with Javascript
* Environment variables for configuration
* Bash
* CLI's
